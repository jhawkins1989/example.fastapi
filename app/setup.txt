venv for terminal:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
also: Interpreter (bottom left) as (venv)

start server (in web browser):
in terminal type uvicorn app.main:app --reload
-> starts FastAPI <app> in file main.py
different path by changing "/" to "/<path>"

path operations -template:
@app.get("/")                                                   #decorator; http operation "get" for retrieving data
async def root():                                               #function
    return {"message": "Hello there! <dies instantly>"}

- order for paths matters

tools to test api: postman

schema for data: use pydantic

CRUD Applications:
- Create, Read, Update, Delete
- Conventions:
    -> were working with posts ie all urls "/post/<...>
    -> Create - POST Request - /posts - @app.post("/posts")
    -> Read - GET Request - /posts/:id - @app.post("/posts/:{id}")
    -> Read - GET Request - /posts - @app.get("/posts")
    -> Update - PUT/PATCH Request - /posts/:id - @app.put("/posts/:{id}") #put: change entire thing, patch: change specific field; doesn't really matter
    -> Delete - DELETE Request - /posts/:id - @app.delete("/posts/:{id}")
